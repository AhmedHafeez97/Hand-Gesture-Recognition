# Hand Gesture Recognition 

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Recognition** project! ðŸš€ This Python-based application uses a live camera feed to recognize hand gestures based on finger positioning. It's designed to detect gloves within a defined region of interest (ROI), calculate Euclidean distances between key points, and map these metrics to pre-programmed gestures. 

---

## Features 

- **Dynamic Gesture Recognition**: Real-time recognition of programmed hand gestures based on the distance between fingers.
- **Region of Interest (ROI)**: Focused detection within a specific area to enhance accuracy and performance.
- **Customizable Gestures**: Easily add or modify gestures by programming new labels and poses.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with Python and optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Camera Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with any standard camera.

## How It Works ðŸ› 

1. **Region of Interest**: The camera feed defines a specific ROI where hand gestures will be detected.
2. **Glove Detection**: The system looks for gloves to ensure high-contrast detection against the background.
3. **Euclidean Metrics**: Key points between fingers are calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
4. **Gesture Mapping**: Pre-programmed gestures are identified based on the measured distances and labeled accordingly.
